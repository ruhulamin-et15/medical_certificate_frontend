    question: "What is a fit note?",
    answer: (
      <div>
        A fit note is an official document provided by a doctor to verify that
        you have a medical condition impacting your capacity to perform your
        job. It is alternatively referred to as a sick note, a medical
        certificate, or a Statement of Fitness for Work. If you have been unwell
        for seven or more consecutive days, including weekends and holidays, you
        must obtain a fit note to be absent from work.
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What can be found on a sick note?",
    answer: (
      <div className="accordion-body">
        A typical sick note contains details about your medical condition or
        injury, offers guidance on what tasks you can or cannot perform at your
        workplace, and specifies how long you are expected to be away from work.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        In some instances, you might be considered fit for certain job duties
        while advised against others. For instance, if you work in a factory and
        have a back injury, you may be able to handle light duties but should
        avoid heavy lifting. <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, a sick note can be utilised by a doctor to suggest
        adjustments that could facilitate your return to work, known as
        &#39;reasonable accommodations&#39;. These adjustments could include:{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Altering your daily job responsibilities.
        <br />
        2. Providing additional support from colleagues or managers.
        <br />
        3. Making changes to your workstation.
        <br />
        4. Adjusting your work hours or schedule.
        <br />
        5. Gradually reintegrating you into work with reduced hours initially.
        <br />
        <br />
        If your employer is unable to implement the doctor&#39;s recommended
        adjustments, the sick note will state that you are &#39;not fit for
        work&#39;.

    question: "How can you get a sick note in the UK?",
    answer: (
      <div className="accordion-body">
        You should schedule an appointment with a GP, either at a nearby
        practice or through Medic Online, to have a medical assessment. The
        MEDIC will then determine your fitness for work and estimate the
        required recovery period before you can resume work. <br />
        <br />
        You can provide your employer with a copy of the sick note while
        retaining the original. If you obtain an online sick note with The MEDIC
        Clinic, it can be conveniently sent to your email inbox without the need
        to leave your home.

  {
    question: "Is it possible to get a sick note for free?",
    answer: (
      <div className="accordion-body">
        If a medical assessment by an NHS doctor determines that you are not fit
        for work, you can receive a sick note free of charge. For those looking
        to obtain a sick note without visiting a physical doctor&#39;s office,
        an alternative option is to schedule a consultation would be with The
        MEDIC Clinic, who can evaluate your eligibility for a sick note for a
        small fee.

  {
    question: "What is self certification?",
    answer: (
      <div className="accordion-body">
        Self-certification is a method that enables you to confirm your own
        illness or injury when you&#39;re absent from work for a continuous
        period of up to seven days. In such cases, there&#39;s no requirement
        for a fit note issued by a doctor. <br />
        <br />
        Upon your return to work following a period of sick leave, your employer
        might guide you to utilise an HR system or a self-certification form.
      </div>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What is the price for obtaining a sick note?",
    answer: (
      <div className="accordion-body">
        Obtaining a sick note from the NHS is free when your absence from work
        exceeds 7 days. However, if you require a private medical certificate
        for a period of 7 days or less, your GP practice may impose a fee.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Employers may request a private medical certificate if you frequently
        have short-term sick leave, but it&#39;s important to note that a sick
        note cannot fulfil this requirement.

      <div className="accordion-body">
        You can always discuss your certificate with us however each certificate
        is carefully considered between our physician associate and doctor
        before being approved. Sometimes its unsafe to give longer times as we
        require you to see your own GP for a review. Othertimes you would need a
        review before a longer time can be given.

        However, if you have reached a 4 week period in total, you would need to
        see your own regular GP.
