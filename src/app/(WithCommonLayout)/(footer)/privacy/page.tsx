            information when it is necessary to fulfil the services we have
            requested. However, please note that payment gateways and other
            payment transaction processors may have their own privacy policies,
            which apply to the information we provide them for purchase-related
            transactions. If you decide to engage with a third-party provider,

            information will be shared with our third-party health
            practitioners, and you also provide consent for this sharing. The
            shared information may include your name, contact details, delivery
            addresses, health details, allergies, prescriptions, and family
            medical history. Additionally, we retain records of your
