        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold my-4">2. Professional Standards</h1>

        <p className="my-5">
          Prescriber Services encompass a thorough process that includes
          reviewing clinical questionnaires, conducting consultations, and
          issuing medical certificates and fit notes. To ensure the provision of
          high-quality care, Healthcare Professionals may also follow up with
          certain patients as part of the service. These Healthcare Professional
          Services are rendered by registered and eligible Healthcare
          Professionals who are authorised to issue Certificates without the
          need for face-to-face interactions. Rest assured that all Healthcare
          Professionals strictly adhere to the guidelines set forth by their
          respective regulatory bodies regarding the remote issuance of fit
          notes.

          We are committed to the following principles when providing the
          Healthcare Professional Services:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-decimal list-inside my-5">
          <li>
            We will assume professional accountability for each patient using
            the Healthcare Professional Services, treating the consultations
            with the same level of responsibility and care as if they were
            conducted in person.
          </li>{" "}
          <br />
          <li>
            Our services will be provided in a professional and transparent
            manner, adhering to the guidelines outlined by the relevant
            regulatory body for issuing fit notes remotely and following
            clinical best practices.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            When issuing fit notes and communicating with patients, we will
            disclose the name and professional registration number of the
            Healthcare Professional involved in the process.
          </li>
          <br />

            Fit notes will only be issued when, based on our professional
            judgement, it is in the patient&#39;s best interest. We will refrain
            from issuing a fit note if we believe it is not in the patient&#39;s
            best interest without conducting a face-to-face consultation.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            We will take reasonable precautions to safeguard patient&#39;s

            accordance with the Privacy Policy.
