                <p className="my-5">
                    Any dispute or claim that arises under these Terms must be notified to us in writing within 14 (fourteen) days of the dispute or claim arising. The written notice should include comprehensive details about the dispute or claim. Failure to provide written notice within the specified time limit will prevent you from making such a claim.
                </p>

                <p className="my-5">
                    In the event of a dispute, both parties agree to seek resolution. If the dispute cannot be resolved within 60 (sixty) days from the initial notification, both parties agree to attempt to settle it through mediation following the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution Model (&#34;CEDR&#34;) Mediation Procedure. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, CEDR will select the mediator. To initiate the mediation process, either party must provide written notice (&#34;ADR Notice&#34;) <br /> requesting mediation and send a copy to CEDR. The mediation will commence no earlier than 60 (sixty) days from the date the ADR written notice is provided. Both parties irrevocably agree that neither may initiate court proceedings <br /> concerning any dispute arising from matters related to these Terms until mediation has been attempted, and either the mediation has concluded, or the other party has failed to participate in the mediation for a period of at least 30 (thirty) days from the start of the mediation.

                <p className="my-5">
                    Each clause in these Terms operates independently. If any court or relevant authority determines that any clause or subclause is unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining clauses and subclauses will remain in full force and effect.
                </p>

                <p className="my-5">
                    Our failure to insist on the performance of any of your obligations under these Terms, to enforce our rights against you, or to delay in doing so, does not waive our rights against you, nor does it relieve you of the responsibility to comply with those obligations. If we waive a default by you, we will do so in writing, and it does not imply an automatic waiver of any future defaults by you.
